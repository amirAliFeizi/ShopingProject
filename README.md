# 🛒 Shopping Cart Application

A sleek and fully functional shopping cart system built with pure JavaScript. This project allows users to add products to a cart, adjust product quantities, view the cart total, and remove items—all while persisting the data using `localStorage`.

## 🌟 Features

- **Add to Cart**: Easily add products to the cart and automatically calculate the total.
- **Quantity Control**: Increase or decrease the quantity of each product directly from the cart modal.
- **LocalStorage Integration**: All cart data is stored locally, so it persists even after refreshing the page.
- **Dynamic Price Calculation**: Total cart value is calculated dynamically based on the quantity and price of items.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
- **Interactive UI**: With a smooth modal and toast notification system.
